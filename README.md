Certainly! Below is a sample README file for your Python programming lessons on arithmetic operators and comparison operators:

---

# Python Programming Lessons

## Lesson 1: Arithmetic Operators

### Addition

```python
# Addition
print(5 + 5)

num1, num2 = 6, 8
total = num1 + num2
print(total)
```

### Subtraction

```python
# Subtraction
print(100 - 76)

number1, number2 = 300, 45
result = number1 - number2
print(result)
```

### Multiplication

```python
# Multiplication
print(5 * 5)

sample1, sample2 = 30, 5
product = sample1 * sample2
print(product)
```

### Division

```python
# Division
print(200 / 10)

sample3, sample4 = 500, 10
div_result = sample3 / sample4
print(div_result)
```

### Modulus

```python
# Modulus
print(200 % 9)

sample5, sample6 = 300, 13
m_result = sample5 % sample6
print(m_result)
```

### Integer Division (Round up to the nearest integer)

```python
# Integer Division
print(346 // 36)

sample7, sample8 = 455, 32
end_result = sample7 // sample8
print(end_result)
```

### Exponentiation

```python
# Exponentiation
print(2 ** 3)

sample9, sample10 = 4, 3
e_result = sample9 ** sample10
print(e_result)
```

### Negation

```python
# Negation
x = 10
neg_x = -x
print(neg_x)  # Output: -10
```

## Lesson 2: Comparison Operators

```python
# Comparison Operators
a = 1
b = 2

print(a == b)
print(a != b)
print(b > a)
print(b < a)
print(a <= b)
print(a >= b)
```
