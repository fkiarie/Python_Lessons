# Luhn Algorithm Implementation

## Overview
This Python script implements the Luhn algorithm, a checksum formula commonly used to validate identification numbers, such as credit card numbers. The Luhn algorithm helps detect simple errors in the entered number.

## Code Explanation
The code defines two functions: `verify_card_number` and `main`.

### `verify_card_number` Function
- **Input:** Takes a `card_number` as a string representing a credit card number.
- **Output:** Returns `True` if the card number is valid according to the Luhn algorithm, and `False` otherwise.

### Algorithm Steps
1. **Reverse the Card Number:**
   - The card number is reversed for easier processing from right to left.

2. **Extract Odd and Even Digits:**
   - Odd and even digits are extracted from the reversed card number.

3. **Sum Odd Digits:**
   - The sum of the odd digits is calculated.

4. **Sum Even Digits:**
   - Each even digit is multiplied by 2, and if the result is greater than or equal to 10, the digits are added individually.
   - The sum of the adjusted even digits is calculated.

5. **Calculate Total Sum:**
   - The total sum is obtained by adding the sums of odd and even digits.

6. **Validate the Card Number:**
   - Returns `True` if the total sum is divisible by 10, indicating a valid card number. Otherwise, returns `False`.

### `main` Function
- The entry point of the program.
- Takes user input for the credit card number.
- Removes spaces and dashes from the entered card number.

### Execution
- The `verify_card_number` function is called with the translated card number.
- If the card number is valid, it prints "VALID!"; otherwise, it prints "INVALID!"

## Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Enter the credit card number when prompted.
3. The script will check the validity of the entered credit card number.
